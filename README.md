by Kurt Pessa

## Initial Steps
1. Created new space `excel-challenge` in Google Drive.
2. Stored `excel-challenge.xlsx` and `excel-challenge.docx` in folder with shareable link at  `https://github.com/kpessa/excel-challenge`

## Section 1
1. Used conditional formatting to color different cells based on `state` column.

2. Created a new `column O`  called `Percent Funded" to determine how much money a campaign made to reach its initial goal.

	- Used conditional formatting to fill each cells using a three-color scale. 
	-  Because percentages did not display properly, changed to numbers: 0 - Dark shade of red, 1 - green, 2 - blue
